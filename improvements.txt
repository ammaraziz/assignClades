Improvements:

1. add checks to account for human error:
	~ Wrong strain/gene in fasta file
	~ Wrong reference (similar to above)
	~ 
	
2. Split operations into 3 chunks:
	~ parse args function (see nextstrain as a good example)
	~ run args function
	~ provanence function
	~ provanence to homologous function
	~
3. Auto detect reference/gene
	~ most likely candidate is sourmash tool for this
	~ blast is also an option but more.... bulky
